# Feature Plans

## User story 1

+ Create a search feature that allows the user to find a pokemon by name.
  + A list of the names and sprites of matching pokemon will appear, styled with responsive grid.

+ Header Reads: "Pick your favorite Pokemon".

+ Hover over a pokemon card, the color changes.

+ When a pokemon card is clicked, a confirm window pops up, asks user if they want to change the color pallete of the page.

+ Your pallete is now a 'insert pokemon name' themed page.

+ Create tests for User Story 1.


## User Story 2

+ Add found Pokemon to a pokedex, that you can scroll through like a carosel.
